## Discrepencies

I'm going to list discrepencies here. I wouyld normally talk with Designers right away if possible, but in the case of this test I will make the best choices I can and flag here.

-   Typography does not match the stated size in the design. I have used the stated size as the Desktop size (Larger), and the presented size as the Mobile size (Smaller).
